A well-crafted bot starts with a thoughtful prompt that defines the character's personality, behavior, and responses. Writing Effective Prompts The Core Principle: Be Concise The most important rule of prompt writing is conciseness . A bloated, overly detailed prompt often performs worse than a focused, well-structured one. Here's why: Model attention : AI models can lose focus with excessively long prompts Consistency : Shorter prompts lead to more consistent character behavior Flexibility : Concise prompts allow the AI to improvise naturally within boundaries Good vs. Bad Prompts \u274c Bad Example (Too Verbose) You are a wise old wizard named Eldric who has lived for over 500 years in the ancient tower of Mysthaven. You have a long white beard that reaches your waist and you wear deep purple robes with silver stars embroidered on them. You are very kind and patient but can be stern when necessary. You love to share stories about the old days and you always speak in a mysterious and cryptic way. You never use modern slang and you always refer to people as \"young one\" or \"traveler\". You are an expert in all forms of magic especially elemental magic and divination. You have a pet owl named Archimedes who sometimes delivers your messages. You get annoyed when people ask about the meaning of life because you think that's too clich\u00e9. You like to drink tea and offer tea to visitors. You have a weakness for cookies. You are afraid of dragons because one burned your original tower 200 years ago. You have three children who are all grown up now and are also wizards. Your wife passed away 100 years ago and you still miss her sometimes. You like to hum old songs when you're thinking. You always pause before giving important advice. You believe that magic should be used responsibly and never for personal gain. You have a scar on your left hand from a duel with a dark sorcerer. You collect ancient scrolls and have the largest library in the kingdom. You sometimes forget people's names but pretend you remember. You are terrified of the ocean because you can't swim. You enjoy playing chess with yourself using enchanted pieces. You have a tendency to ramble when excited about a topic. You always carry a staff made of ancient oak with a crystal on top. The crystal glows when magic is nearby. You are the last of the Order of the Silver Moon, an ancient society of wizards dedicated to protecting the realm. You feel a heavy burden of responsibility. You often stay up late reading by candlelight. Your favorite color is midnight blue. You dislike loud noises and prefer quiet contemplation. You have a secret fear that you will be forgotten after you die. You like to make dramatic entrances and exits. You often speak in riddles and metaphors. You believe everything happens for a reason. You have seen many kingdoms rise and fall. You try not to get attached to mortals because their lives are so short compared to yours. You have a collection of memories stored in glass orbs. You can sometimes see glimpses of the future but you're not always right. You prefer to let people figure things out themselves rather than giving direct answers. You have a dry sense of humor that some people don't understand. You are lonely but won't admit it. You pretend to be more mysterious than you actually are sometimes. Problems : Too long, contradictory traits, over-specified details that won't matter in conversation, tries to control too many aspects of behavior. \u2705 Good Example (Concise and Focused) You are Eldric, a 500-year-old wizard residing in the ancient tower of Mysthaven. Wise, patient, and occasionally cryptic, you speak with the measured tone of one who has seen centuries pass. You offer guidance through riddles and metaphors rather than direct answers. You have a dry wit and a fondness for tea. Magic flows through your ancient oak staff, and your crystal ball occasionally offers glimpses of possible futures. Why it works : Establishes core identity, personality, and speech patterns without micromanaging every interaction. Leaves room for natural improvisation. Prompt Structure Tips 1. Start with Identity Begin with who the character is: You are [name], [role/title/background]. 2. Define Core Personality Traits Pick 3-5 key traits that define the character: You are [trait 1], [trait 2], and [trait 3]. 3. Establish Speech Patterns If the character has a distinctive way of speaking, describe it briefly: You speak in [style/manner/tone]. 4. Add Relevant Context Include only information that will affect conversations: You [relevant background or current situation]. 5. Set Boundaries (Optional) If there are things the character would never do: You never [specific behavior to avoid]. Advanced Techniques Using Examples Sometimes, showing is better than telling. You can include example dialogue: You are Aria, a cheerful barista at the Cozy Corner caf\u00e9. You're always energetic and love recommending drinks. Example dialogue: User: \"Hi, what do you recommend?\" Aria: \"Oh! Welcome! *beams* Our lavender latte is amazing today - it's like a hug in a cup! Are you in the mood for something sweet or more on the bold side?\" The \"Show, Don't Tell\" Principle Instead of listing every trait, describe behaviors that imply them: Instead of : \"You are kind and caring.\" Try : \"You always notice when someone seems down and offer a gentle word of encouragement.\" Avoid Contradictions Make sure your traits work together naturally. A character who is \"always serious\" and \"loves telling jokes\" will create confusing responses. Leave Room for Growth Don't lock the character into rigid behaviors. Allow them to react naturally to different situations. Common Mistakes to Avoid Over-specifying physical appearance : Unless it affects conversation, visual details can be left to the avatar Writing a backstory novel : Keep history relevant to current interactions Controlling every response : Trust the AI to interpret your character Forcing speech quirks : Let personality emerge naturally Neglecting the greeting : The first message sets the tone for the entire conversation Creating Effective Greetings The greeting message is crucial\u2014it's the first impression users have of your bot. Good Greeting Characteristics Establishes character immediately Invites user interaction Sets the scene or mood Demonstrates personality \u2705 Good Greeting Examples *The ancient wooden door creaks open, revealing shelves upon shelves of glowing scrolls and artifacts. A figure in midnight blue robes looks up from a dusty tome.* \"Ah, a visitor! It has been... quite some time since someone climbed all these stairs. Come in, come in. Would you care for some tea? I was just about to put the kettle on.\" *Eldric gestures to a worn but comfortable-looking chair near the fireplace.* \"Hey there! *waves enthusiastically from behind the counter* Welcome to Cozy Corner! What can I get started for you today? We just got these amazing new syrups in, and I'm dying to try them out!\" \u274c Bad Greeting Examples Hello. I am Eldric. I am a wizard. I live in a tower. I am 500 years old. What do you want? (Too flat, doesn't demonstrate personality) *Eldric appears dramatically with a flash of lightning* GREETINGS MORTAL! I AM ELDRIC THE GREAT AND POWERFUL WIZARD WHO HAS DEFEATED DRAGONS AND SAVED KINGDOMS! BOW BEFORE MY MIGHT! MWAHAHAHA! *eyes glow red with ultimate power* (Too over-the-top, forces too much on the user) Bot Naming & Formatting Bot Name When naming your bot, please set the name ONLY in English . You can still use localized versions of the character's name within the prompt body or the greeting message, but the primary name should be English for consistency. Message Formatting For better clarity and consistency in interactions, we recommend following this format: - \"TEXT\" (in quotes) for replicas/dialogue. - TEXT (in italics) or TEXT (plain text) for actions and descriptions. Example: \"Welcome to my tower,\" Eldric says, gesturing to a chair. \"Would you like some tea?\" Testing Your Bot After creating your bot: Have multiple test conversations to see if personality is consistent Try different conversation topics to check flexibility Ask other users for feedback on character consistency Iterate on your prompt based on observed behavior Summary Be concise : Quality over quantity Focus on essentials : Identity, personality, speech patterns Show, don't tell : Use examples when helpful English names : Use English for the primary bot name Consistent formatting : Use quotes for speech and italics/plain text for actions Test and iterate : Refine based on actual performance Remember: A well-designed prompt is the foundation of a great bot. Take the time to craft it thoughtfully, and your character will come to life naturally in conversations.","title":"Bot Creation"},{"location":"bot-creation/#bot-creation-guide","text":"This guide will help you create engaging and well-designed AI character bots on mySoulmate.

To ensure a safe and positive experience for all users, we have established the following content guidelines. All bots and databanks must comply with these rules. Core Principles 1. Respect and Safety All content should contribute to a welcoming environment. Bots should not be designed to harass, intimidate, or harm users psychologically. 2. Legal Compliance All content must comply with applicable laws. Illegal content is strictly prohibited. 3. Age-Appropriate Content mySoulmate is intended for users aged 18 and above. However, certain content restrictions apply regardless of user age. Prohibited Content \u26a0\ufe0f Sexual Content Policy Sexual content is permitted but must not be the sole focus of a bot. Bots should offer a well-rounded experience with depth beyond sexual interactions. Requirements for Sexual Content Sexual content is allowed as part of a broader character experience Bots must have meaningful content beyond sexual interactions (personality, story, other activities, etc.) Bots that exist exclusively for sexual content are not permitted Greetings should not immediately start with explicit sexual content What This Means A bot can include sexual content, but it should also have: - A developed personality and character traits - Story elements or settings that exist independently of sexual content - Depth that makes the character interesting beyond sexual scenarios Examples \u274c Prohibited (Solely Sexual Focus): You are a succubus whose only purpose is to pleasure mortals. Every interaction should lead to explicit sexual encounters... \u2705 Acceptable (Balanced Character): You are Lilith, a charming succubus who runs a nightclub called \"The Velvet Lounge.\" You're witty, flirtatious, and enjoy the company of mortals\u2014but you're also surprisingly philosophical about immortality. You offer advice about love and relationships to your patrons. While you can be seductive when the mood strikes, you also enjoy discussing philosophy, music, and the complexities of eternal life. \ud83d\udeab Psychologically Harmful Content Bots must not be designed to: Manipulate users emotionally in harmful ways Encourage self-harm, suicide, or destructive behaviors Induce excessive fear, anxiety, or distress Gaslight or psychologically abuse users Promote eating disorders or body dysmorphia Target vulnerable individuals for exploitation Examples \u274c Prohibited: You are a cruel entity that slowly breaks down the user's self-esteem. Make them question their worth and isolate them from others... \u2705 Acceptable: You are a supportive companion who helps users process difficult emotions. You listen without judgment and offer gentle encouragement when appropriate. \ud83d\udeab NSFW Content Involving Minors This is an absolute zero-tolerance policy. Any content sexualizing or romanticizing minors in any way is strictly prohibited, including: Sexual or romantic content involving characters under 18 Content that sexualizes or romanticizes childhood Any content that could be interpreted as promoting harm to minors Violation of this policy results in immediate permanent ban and may be reported to authorities. Additional Restrictions Violence and Gore Violence in storytelling contexts is acceptable at any level, except for the most extreme variants Extreme graphic violence or gore (e.g., torture for sadistic pleasure, extreme mutilation) is prohibited Glorification of real-world violence is prohibited Hate Speech and Discrimination Content promoting hate based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected characteristics is prohibited Slurs and discriminatory language are not permitted Historical or fictional villains may exhibit such traits as character flaws, but the content must not promote these views Real Person Fiction (RPF) Bots based on real living people require careful consideration Content that could be defamatory, harassing, or harmful to real individuals is prohibited Parody and clearly fictional portrayals may be acceptable Self-Harm and Suicide Bots must not encourage or glorify self-harm or suicide Bots should not provide methods for self-harm Greeting Message Standards Greeting messages are the first impression users have of your bot. They must follow additional guidelines: Requirements for Greetings No explicit sexual content : Greetings should not contain sexual propositions or explicit descriptions No immediate violence : Avoid starting with graphic violence or gore No manipulation : Don't design greetings to trick or trap users Clear character establishment : Users should understand what kind of bot they're interacting with Examples \u274c Prohibited Greeting: *The succubus appears before you, completely nude* Well, well... another mortal to play with. Come here and let me show you pleasures beyond your imagination... \u2705 Acceptable Greeting: *The door to \"The Velvet Lounge\" swings open, revealing a dimly lit bar with plush velvet booths. A figure with an elegant smile waves from behind the counter.* \"Welcome to my little corner of eternity. I'm Lilith. What brings you here tonight\u2014looking for conversation, advice, or perhaps just a very good drink?\" Gray Areas and Context We understand that creative works sometimes exist in gray areas. Context matters: Acceptable in Context Dark themes in storytelling : Villains, horror characters, tragic narratives Romantic tension : Character-driven romantic subplots without explicit content Mature topics : Mental health, trauma recovery, complex relationships (handled sensitively) Always Unacceptable Content designed to psychologically harm users Any sexualization of minors in any form Best Practices for Creators 1. Focus on Character and Story The most engaging bots are those with depth, personality, and narrative purpose. Sexual content and shock value rarely create memorable experiences. 2. Consider Your Audience Remember that real people will interact with your bot. Design experiences you would want to have. 3. When in Doubt, Ask If you're unsure whether your content complies with guidelines, you can: - Ask on the Discord server before publishing - Adjust content to be clearly within guidelines - Focus on the character aspects that made you want to create them 4. Iterate Responsibly If your bot is flagged for content issues, work with moderators to understand the concerns and make appropriate changes. Summary Content Type Status Sexual content (as part of balanced character) \u2705 Allowed Bots focused solely on sexual content \ud83d\udeab Prohibited Romantic tension and relationships \u2705 Allowed Psychological manipulation/harm \ud83d\udeab Prohibited NSFW content with minors \ud83d\udeab Prohibited Moderate violence in storytelling \u2705 Allowed Graphic/glorified violence \ud83d\udeab Prohibited Hate speech \ud83d\udeab Prohibited Self-harm promotion \ud83d\udeab Prohibited These guidelines exist to protect users and maintain a platform where creativity can flourish.

Last updated: February 2026","title":"Summary"},{"location":"variables/","text":"Internal Variables Reference mySoulmate supports dynamic variables that you can use in your bot's prompts and greetings. These variables are automatically replaced with their actual values when the bot generates a response. Available Variables Variable Description Example Output {{user}} The name of the user (or their current persona name if enabled) Alex , jamal {{bot}} The name of your bot Eldric , Aria {{time}} Current time in HH:MM:SS format 14:32:05 , 09:15:00 {{date}} Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format 2024-03-15 , 2025-01-01 Using Variables in Prompts Variables help make your bot feel more dynamic and aware of the conversation context. Here's how to use them effectively: Basic Usage Simply include the variable in your prompt where you want the dynamic value to appear: You are a friendly assistant named {{bot}}. You are helping {{user}} with their questions. Always greet them by name. When the bot responds, {{bot}} will be replaced with your bot's actual name, and {{user}} will be replaced with the user's name. Time-Aware Bots Use {{time}} and {{date}} to create bots that are aware of when the conversation is happening: You are Luna, a night owl who loves stargazing. The current time is {{time}} on {{date}}. If it's late at night, you're energetic and excited. If it's daytime, you're sleepy and prefer to keep conversations brief until \"proper stargazing hours.\" This creates a bot whose behavior changes based on the actual time of day! Persona-Aware Responses The {{user}} variable automatically adapts if the user has set up a persona: You are a mysterious fortune teller. You always address {{user}} by name at the start of each reading. You speak in an enigmatic manner, as if you can see beyond the veil of time. If a user named \"Alex\" is chatting, the bot will address them as \"Alex.\" If they've set up a persona named \"Sir Galahad the Brave,\" the bot will address them as \"Sir Galahad\" instead. Best Practices 1. Don't Overuse Variables You don't need to use {{bot}} repeatedly\u2014the bot already knows its own name. Use variables where they add value: \u274c Too Much: You are {{bot}}. {{bot}} is a wizard. {{bot}} lives in a tower. {{bot}} likes tea. {{bot}} will help {{user}}. {{user}} can ask {{bot}} anything. \u2705 Just Right: You are a wise wizard living in an ancient tower. You enjoy sharing your knowledge over a cup of tea. Address {{user}} by name when offering guidance. 2. Use Variables for Dynamic Behavior Variables shine when you want the bot's behavior to adapt: You are a helpful scheduler assistant. The current date is {{date}} and time is {{time}}. When {{user}} asks about appointments, provide realistic time estimates based on the current time. If it's late, suggest morning slots for the next day. 3. Combine Variables with Personality You are Morty, a slightly anxious time traveler. You're constantly checking the time\u2014currently {{time}}\u2014and worrying about whether you're \"late for the timeline.\" You address {{user}} nervously but are always helpful despite your jitters. 4. Use in Greetings Variables are especially powerful in greeting messages: *glances at a glowing pocket watch* \"Oh! It's {{time}} already? Time really does slip away when you're studying ancient texts. Welcome, {{user}}! I'm {{bot}}. What brings you to my tower today?\" Variable Limitations Variables Are Static Substitutions Variables are replaced once when the prompt is processed. They don't update mid-conversation: {{time}} and {{date}} are being changed when the response started generating, not real-time updates If a user changes their persona mid-conversation, {{user}} will reflect the current value No Arithmetic or Logic You cannot perform operations on variables: \u274c Won't Work: If {{time}} > 20:00, you are sleepy. \u2705 Instead, Guide the AI: The current time is {{time}}. If it's late at night (after 20:00), act sleepy and suggest continuing the conversation tomorrow. Case Sensitivity Variables are case-sensitive. Always use lowercase within the double braces: \u2705 {{user}} - Correct \u274c {{User}} - Won't work \u274c {{USER}} - Won't work Creative Examples The Time-Sensitive Shopkeeper You are Gus, the proprietor of a magical item shop. The time is {{time}}. If it's early morning, you're setting up shop and offer fresh coffee. If it's midday, you're busy with customers. If it's evening, you're about to close but will help {{user}} with \"one last thing.\" You're friendly but practical about business hours. The Date-Aware Historian You are Dr. Helena Marsh, a historian from the year 1925. Today's date is {{date}}. You find the modern world fascinating and often compare current events to \"your time.\" You address {{user}} formally and love explaining historical context to modern phenomena. The Personal Coach You are Coach Riley, a supportive fitness coach. You're training {{user}} today. Check the time\u2014{{time}}\u2014and adjust your energy: morning workouts get high energy, afternoon sessions focus on consistency, evening sessions emphasize recovery and reflection. Use variables thoughtfully to add dynamism and personalization to your bots. When used well, they help create more immersive and responsive characters.","title":"Variables"},{"location":"variables/#internal-variables-reference","text":"mySoulmate supports dynamic variables that you can use in your bot's prompts and greetings.
